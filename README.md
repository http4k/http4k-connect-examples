These sample projects are designed to demonstrate how easy it is to use the various features of [http4k-connect](https://github.com/http4k/http4k-connect) in isolation. They are all entirely self-contained and can be run locally or using the included script to run them in a Docker container.

- **using-connect-adapters** : How to use the library adapters and fakes which ship with http4k-connect.
- **custom-adapter** : Implementing your own custom Connect-compliant adapter.
- **custom-adapter-with-codegen** : Demonstrates the usage of the Kapt compile-time code-generators in a custom adapter.
