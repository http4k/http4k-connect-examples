# The Connect pattern

This is the example code accompanying [the post](https://dentondav.id/2021/02/smash-your-adapter-monolith) describing the basic Connect pattern and how it is structured. It only relies on [http4k](https://http4k.org) as a basic implementation platform.

The other examples in this repo show **http4k-connect** specific use-cases which contain slightly more complete functionality than this basic example.
