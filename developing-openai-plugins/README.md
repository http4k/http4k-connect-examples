# Developing OpenAI plugins

Using the http4k-connect-openai-plugin SDK to create OpenAI plugins. This example includes the same example using all of the different OpenAI plugin styles, and installs them into the `FakeOpenAI` so you can interact with them in an authorised way through an OpenAPI interface.

To see the plugins in action, run the `main.kt` and follow the instructions.
